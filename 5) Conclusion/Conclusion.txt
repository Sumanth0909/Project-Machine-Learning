Now that we have completed the prediction using both FB_Prophet and ARIMA (for the same city and same time duration), we can compare the results of both the models.
By looking at MAE and MAPE values for multiple predictions for multiple cities and multiple time durations, we could safely conclude that FB_Prophet MODEL PERFORMS BETTER AS COMPARED TO ARIMA MODEL ; which actually validates whatever was seen through literature study (After studying multiple articles, blogs and research papers, it was found that FB_Prophet performed better than ARIMA in general ; which tallies with our findings too).
This is because, FB_Prophet works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Also, it is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well.
