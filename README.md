Welcome to our Project!


In this project, we have done the forecast of Air Quality Index (AQI) value based on the user input for the city and for the time duration which he/she wants. 
We have used the dataset from the Central Govt. website  https://cpcb.nic.in/  

We have leveraged FB_Prophet model for doing the forecasting. And later on, we have done the forecast for the same city and for the same time duration, using ARIMA model.
And then we have compared the results from both the forecasts.

Finally, we end this Project by creating an Web-Based Interactive GUI where the user has multiple options - like the option to input his/her own dataset file, 
varying the ratio of (training data : testing data), varying the values of 'p','d','q' in the case of ARIMA model etc. The changes can be seen on-the-spot.
Also, dashboards have been included in the 'prediction' section - making it even more interactive!

To run the Web-Based Interactive GUI, open the "AQIFinal.py" file in an Python IDE (preferably VS Code)
Run the "AQIFinal.py" code
And in the terminal, type "streamlit run Your_File_Name.py" (in our case, it is "streamlit run Final.py") and run it.
Please feel free to play around a bit :)
